            <h1>TOP CITY BREAKS IN ITALY: TOP ITALIAN CITY BREAKS</h1>
            <p>
                Italy is home to some of the world’s most iconic and famous cities. So here is our guide to the best city breaks in Italy from the very north to the very south of the country. It’s an eclectic mix of cities so plenty to suit all tastes.
            </p>
            <h2>Florence</h2>
            <p>
                One of Italy’s most iconic cities, Florence is the perfect city for <a href="https://bookingsforyou.com/blog/best-villas-in-italy-for-art-lovers/">art lovers</a> and historians. Home of the Renaissance, its plethora of world famous museums and galleries are packed with works of art by Giotto, Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Raphael and others. Its skyline is dominated by the Duomo, the piazza around which tends to be the focal point for most holidaymaker visits. However, it’s also home to some incredibly beautiful gardens equally worth exploring.

            </p>
            <p>
                Nearest airport: Visitors can fly into Amerigo Vespucci Airport, just 3 km from the centre of the city. Or, alternatively, fly into nearby Pisa and catch the train or a bus from there to Florence itself. The high speed train will take less than 50 minutes.
            </p>
            <h2>Bologna</h2>
            <p>
                Italy’s foodie capital, Bologna is definitely a city that is on the up. The capital of <a href="https://bookingsforyou.com/blog/6-great-reasons-to-visit-emilia-romagna-summer-2023/">Emilia Romagna</a>, it’s home to some stunning architectural gems, not least its leaning towers, the Archiginnasio and the buildings that surround the Piazza Maggiore. It’s also famous for the San Luca monastery that looks down over the city below along with the 40 km of porticoes that the city boasts. However, many do come to enjoy Bologna’s gastronomic heritage. Emilia-Romagna is home to the highest number of DOP products anywhere in Italy and Bologna is the ideal place to sample them, including delicious Parmigiano Reggiano, mortadella, prosciutto, Grana Padano and balsamic vinegar. Not forgetting, of course, that Bologna is also home to the famous ragu!

            <p>
                Nearest airport: Fly into Guglielmo Marconi Airport which is approximately 7 kilometres from the city centre.
            </p>
            <h2>Pisa</h2>
            <p>
                Synonymous with its famous leaning tower, Pisa is the perfect sized city to see in a weekend. Whilst everyone visits to admire its leaning tower, the tower is just one of the incredible architectural feats that the Piazza dei Miracoli is home to. In fact, this 22 acre walled area north of the river Arno also includes the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta, Baptistery and Campo Santo. But Pisa has so much more to offer visitors just a short walk from here as well.

            </p>
            <p>
                Nearest airport: Pisa International Airport, also called Galileo Galilei Airport, is just a 15 minute drive from the historic centre of Pisa. A high speed train also runs every 5-8 minutes between 6 a.m. and midnight between Pisa train station and the airport.
            </p>
            <h2>Venice</h2>
            <p>
                The city that is built on water, Venice is simply iconic. It’s also one of Italy’s most romantic cities. A truly unique destination and a city unlike any other, Venice is made up of over 100 islands connected by a network of canals and bridges. Visitors will inevitably flock to its central square – the Piazza San Marco – but there is another <a href="https://bookingsforyou.com/blog/once-upon-a-time-in-venice-discovering-the-hidden-city/">hidden Venice</a> away from the crowds that we encourage you to also explore.

            </p>
            <p>
                Nearest airport: Venice Marco Polo airport is located about 6 km north of the city of Venice on the edge of the lagoon. From here you can catch a taxi or bus to take you towards the city centre. Or opt for the more glamorous way to travel – water taxi. For us, the best way to travel into Venice is by train though. Stepping off the train onto the platform in Venice is an arrival like no other.
            </p>
            <h2>Rome</h2>
            <p>
                Italy’s capital city needs no introduction. A walk through Rome’s streets is like a living history lesson so it’s the perfect Italian city for budding historians. Home to the what must be the most impressive Roman remains anywhere in Europe – the Colosseum and Pantheon – it’s also home to equally impressive later constructions such as the Trevi Fountain and Vittoriano. Not only that but it’s also where you will find the Vatican city, the world’s smallest state, and headquarters of the Roman Catholic church.
            </p>

                Nearest airport: Rome is served by two airports. Rome Fuimicino is the the main international airport used by the biggest airlines such as American Airlines and British Airways. Rome Ciampino is a smaller, secondary airport that caters more to budget airlines such as Ryanair, Wizz Air and Easyjet.
